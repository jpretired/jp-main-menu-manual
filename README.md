## Description

This custom module adds an item to the main menu.
Behind that item there is a link to a webtrees manual in English, Czech or German language.
This module is inspired by a [module of JustCarmen](https://github.com/JustCarmen/webtrees-simple-menu).
Then Hermann Hartenthaler has contributed with valuable proposals.
